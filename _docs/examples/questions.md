Parallel sources, generates, and improves AI forecasting questions. We think this crucial in order to build a repository of predictions which are not just *accurate*, but also *useful* to organisations making progress on AI safety and policy.

Below are a subset of the questions we've listed:

- [By 2022, will there have been a case of >=$10M of damage caused by adversarial examples in a coordinated action?](https://ai.metaculus.com/questions/163/by-2022-will-there-have-been-a-case-of-10m-of-damage-caused-by-adversarial-examples-in-a-coordinated-action/)

- [Will OpenAI Five win against the reigning Dota 2 world champions OG?]('https://ai.metaculus.com/questions/135/will-openai-five-win-against-the-reigning-dota-2-world-champions-og/')

- [When will an RL agent match the best human performance on Starcraft II with no domain-specific hardcoded knowledge, trained using no more than $10,000 of compute of public hardware?](https://ai.metaculus.com/questions/2/when-will-an-rl-agent-match-the-best-human-performance-on-starcraft-ii-with-no-domain-specific-hardcoded-knowledge-trained-using-no-more-than-10000-of-compute-of-public-hardware/)

- [By mid-2020, what will be the maximum compute (measured in petaflop/s-days), used in training by a published AI system?](https://ai.metaculus.com/questions/8/by-mid-2020-what-will-be-the-maximum-compute-measured-in-petaflops-days-used-in-training-by-a-published-ai-system/)

- [By end of 2020, will another state-of-the-art model be only partially released due to explicit concerns about malicious use?]('https://ai.metaculus.com/questions/117/by-end-of-2020-will-another-state-of-the-art-model-be-only-partially-released-due-to-explicit-concerns-about-malicious-use/')

- [[Centralisation of AGI] When 99% of jobs are automatable, will a single actor be responsible for >=50% of world output or energy consumption?](https://ai.metaculus.com/questions/167/centralisation-of-agi-when-99-of-jobs-are-automatable-will-a-single-actor-be-responsible-for-50-of-world-output-or-energy-consumption/)

Weâ€™re also setting up various initiatives to improve our ability to capture important uncertainties in clear questions, including the Resolution Dictionary and the Resolution Council.

**We can help with operationalizing question ideas**

If you have uncertainties you think it would be useful to forecast, do [email us](mailto:hello@parallelforecast.com).

When making your suggestions:

- Feel free to be brief, hand-wavy, etc.
- We've found that in early stages the gist underlying a question is more important than the exact formulation, so make sure to mention *why* you care about your suggested question
- In case questions are promising, the Parallel team has the bandwidth to help with operationalising, gathering background data and crafting good resolution conditions.
- In case something is hard to capture using only a single question, we can get at it using a "Bayesian question cluster" of multiple related questions.
